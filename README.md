Tiny Shelter .NET course project

## Description
This is webpage for a small shelter. The database is seeded with a few cat and dog profiles.
The program starts from Home/Index. On the main page there is a link to the list page where all animals currently in the shelter are shown.
We can also get to this page from the nav-bar, the Pets icon. The Main page is responsive to various screen sizes.
The list page can be also reached by Animals/Index as well.
Here we can either add a new animal or click on the detail button for any of the list items to get to the details page.
Here either view entry details or can select to edit or delete the item. That takes to the add/edit page (the same as the new entry add page, except this time the values are prepopulated.
